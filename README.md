# InstaJS v3.1

It runs as a command line interface on your devices and will interact to Instagram users (configurable). You choose a list of Instagram users whose market you want to target. The bot navigates to each of these, finds the last people and then like, follow & comments each of them (also configurable), it will interact to target users. Simple and effective.

The bot will remember every user it has followed, liked & comments so if you quit the app and open it later, it will still clean up by remember users that it previously already interacted.
